# Age of Triggers

This is a very early work in progress.

This is an api for python 3.4. You can read and write .aoe2scenario map files for AOE2 Definitive Edition.

It was initially a fork from agescx [https://github.com/dderevjanik/agescx].

How to install:

pip3 install git+https://github.com/ncarrara/age-of-triggers.git


# TODO
- [WIP] clean code and make it pep8
